RecycleMe is an image recognition-based recycling management system powered by Google Vision.  
This project aims at making recycling faster and more convenient.  
The user can take a picture of a certain item and our Machine Learning Model will determine its recyclability and where to recycle it.  
Our map takes in a collection of data from the Google Maps API and user-generated data by both our standard users and by businesses.
